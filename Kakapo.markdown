The **kākāpō** ( [*KAAH-KAAH-POOR*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key),from [Māori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Māori_language): *kākāpō*, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation) 'night parrot')[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo#cite_note-3), also called **owl parrot** (*Strigops habroptilus*), is a species of large, [flightless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flightless_bird), [nocturnal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_animal), ground-dwelling parrot of the super-family [Strigopoidea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_parrot), [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism_in_birds) to [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand).[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo#cite_note-Best1984-4)

It has finely blotched yellow-green plumage, a distinct facial  disc, a large grey beak, short legs, large feet, and relatively short  wings and tail. A combination of traits make it unique among parrots: it is the world's only flightless [parrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot), the world's heaviest parrot, nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly [sexually dimorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism) in body size, has a low [basal metabolic rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate), and no male parental care, and is the only parrot to have a [polygynous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygyny_in_animals) [lek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek_(mating_arena)) breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world's longest-living birds, with a reported lifespan of up to 100 years.[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakapo#cite_note-Powlesland2006-5)
